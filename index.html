        <h3>Introduction:</h3>
        <p>One of the most controversial topics in the very young generation of the world is the debate 
          between which comic is better: DC or Marvel! There are many ways to compare the two from the 
          comic books to the movies to the character themselves. The comparisons themselves yield many 
          results and that itself can be a debatable topic. For this assignment, I have chosen movies 
          to compare the two. I have taken data of the movies from both the franchise from the year 
          2008 to 2019. The movies that are included as a part of the dataset are only the ones that 
          belong in the respective universes, i.e. each of the movies within the franchise, is a part 
          of the same universe and their characters and storylines have crossovers. I have taken the 
          data from the following website:
          <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/leonardopena/marvel-vs-dc">https://www.kaggle.com/leonardopena/marvel-vs-dc</a>.
          I have used Python along with Pandas library to process the data according to my usecase.
          I am using the IMDB ratings, Gross revenue and the budget of the movies to compare and show 
          you the results. We can also hover over th points in the chart to see more details about the 
          points/bars that are plotted.
        </p>

        <h3>Left Chart:</h3>
        <p>The left chart shows you a scatter plot showing the budget of the movies plotted agains their
          respective IMDB ratings. The plot itself has been divided into four quadrants based on the average
          budget of the movies ($18M) and a preferred IMDB rating of movies. From the graph, we can infer 
          that DC has highest rated movies compared to Marvel. Apart from that information, we can also 
          see that DC has a lower budget for a movie on an average and also is very performant in 
          the production of the movie withing that budget as we can see from the left-top quadrant, DC
          has created the best movies that has better IMDB ratings at a much lower
          budget compared to Marvel. Marvel has also produced very good movies with IMDB rating above 8.0
          but the cost of its production is also significantly high (especially for Endgame and Infinity War).
          Hence the left chart is pro-DC.
        </p>
        <h3>Right Chart:</h3>
        <p>The chart on the right shows the Gross return for the movies in Millions of Dollars across the 
          globe. Clearly from that graph we can see that not only Marvel has produced more number of movies
          in the given years, but also their average returns is a lot higher in value compared to DC. This shows
          that the money they invest that we can see from the left chart, is being returned in a profitable 
          fashion. Hence this part is pro-Marvel.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Rhetorics:
        </h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Omission: I have excluded the duration of the movie, the Revenue made on the first day and 
              the revenue made in the US as it is irrelevant to my argument.
            </li>
            <li>
              Anchoring: I have added quadrants to the chart on the left to show who is being supported by
              given chart.
            </li>
            <li>
              Comparison: I have used colors (red and blue) to differentiate the Marvel and DC movies.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cultural codes: I have added the svg image of the winner of that chart on the top corners of 
              its respective containers.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>
          Personal Opinion:
        </h3>
        <p>
          My personal opinion is that Marvel is the winner when it comes to comparisons with movies. This is 
          because they have been consistent in terms of the IMDB ratings even if they dont have movies that are
          as good as the best ones in DC. Most of the movies are clustered around 7.0 - 7.5 which is approximately 
          the average ratings of all the movies. They also have steady returns in terms of revenue and the profit 
          that they make is more than that of DC. They have also produced a lot more movies in the cinematic universe
          than that of DC. Hence, I feel Marvel is better than DC with respect to movies.
